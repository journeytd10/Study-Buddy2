Problem: Simply re-reading notes can give the illusion of competence but may not aid in actual memory retention.Method: Use flashcards or practice tests to regularly quiz yourself on the material you've learned. This forces you to retrieve information from memory, strengthening the knowledge and making it easier to recall in the future."),

Without spaced repetition, memory retention can decrease rapidly.Method: Use a spaced repetition system (SRS) or app to plan out your study sessions. Review the material after one day, then two days, then four days, and so on, to enhance long-term retention."),

This can improve problem-solving skills because it teaches you to recognize and apply different strategies.")

For instance, when you write down a definition, draw a picture that represents the concept, or find a diagram that illustrates it.")
